Some details about the functionalities that don't work very well:

The double click work only if you don't click on the checkbox 
The displaying of informations display the informations of the selected images (not folders, and not necessary the on on wich you clicked)

generalities :

The majority of the functions are in the FileServicePlugin service
The folder and ImageFile class are not very well implemented, sorry about that

I made an UML diagram if it can help you see more clearely
